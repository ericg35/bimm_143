# PDB Statistics

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from "Analyze" \> "PDB Statistics" \> "by Experimental Method and Molecular Type".

Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:

```{r}
db <- read.csv("PDB.csv")
#db
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(db)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}

(db$X.ray)

```

```{r}
gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)
```

```{r}
xray.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)))
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$EM)))
```

Can i write a function instead of repeating the same line of code?

```{r}
  # I will work with `x` as input.
sum_comma <- function(x) {
    # Substitute the comma and convert to numeric
    sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray)
sum_comma(db$EM)
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray)/ sum_comma(db$Total)
```

For EM:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$EM)/ sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED!

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

the structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 angstrom resolution to see hydrogen

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working With a Structure in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

 pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")

pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal more analysis )

```{r}
# Perform flexibility prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie"(a.k.a. trajectory) of the motion for a viewing in MOlstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

Answer: 198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

Answer: MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

Answer: 2
